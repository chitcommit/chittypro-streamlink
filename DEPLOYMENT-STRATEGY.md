# üéØ ChittyPro Streamlink Deployment Strategy

## Current Situation Analysis

### What We Found:
- ‚úÖ **Domain Active**: derail.me is live and serving content
- ‚úÖ **Behind Cloudflare**: Using Cloudflare proxy for security and CDN
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Existing Application**: A "Reolink Viewer" application is currently deployed
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **SSH Not Exposed**: SSH port 22 not accessible through Cloudflare (security best practice)

### Deployment Options:

## Option 1: Replace Existing Application (Recommended if you own derail.me)
Replace the current Reolink Viewer with ChittyPro Streamlink.

**Pros:**
- Clean installation at root domain
- Full control over derail.me
- Simplest URL structure

**Steps:**
1. Access your actual server (not through Cloudflare)
2. Find the server's real IP address in your hosting provider
3. SSH directly to that IP: `ssh deploy@<real-ip>`
4. Run deployment scripts
5. Update Cloudflare to point to new application

## Option 2: Deploy to Subdomain
Deploy ChittyPro Streamlink to a subdomain like `stream.derail.me` or `cameras.derail.me`

**Pros:**
- Keep existing Reolink Viewer running
- No conflicts with current setup
- Easy to manage multiple applications

**Steps:**
1. Create subdomain in Cloudflare
2. Point subdomain to your server
3. Update deployment configs for subdomain
4. Deploy ChittyPro Streamlink

## Option 3: Deploy to Path
Deploy ChittyPro Streamlink to a path like `derail.me/chittypro`

**Pros:**
- Both applications on same domain
- Share SSL certificate
- Simpler DNS management

**Cons:**
- Nginx configuration more complex
- Path-based routing needed

## Option 4: Deploy to Cloudflare Workers (Easiest)
Since derail.me is already on Cloudflare, deploy ChittyPro Streamlink as a Cloudflare Worker.

**Pros:**
- No server SSH access needed
- Fully serverless
- Automatic scaling
- Built-in CDN
- HTTPS included

**Steps:**
1. Install Wrangler CLI: `npm install -g wrangler`
2. Login to Cloudflare: `wrangler login`
3. Update wrangler configuration
4. Deploy: `wrangler deploy`

## üöÄ RECOMMENDED ACTION: Cloudflare Workers Deployment

Since derail.me is already using Cloudflare, let's deploy ChittyPro Streamlink as a Cloudflare Worker for instant deployment:

### Quick Setup Commands:

```bash
# 1. Install Wrangler (if not already installed)
npm install -g wrangler

# 2. Login to Cloudflare
wrangler login

# 3. Create wrangler.toml configuration
cat > wrangler.toml << 'EOF'
name = "chittypro-streamlink"
main = "dist/worker.js"
compatibility_date = "2024-01-01"

[env.production]
name = "chittypro-streamlink-prod"
route = "derail.me/cameras/*"
# OR use a subdomain:
# route = "stream.derail.me/*"

[[env.production.d1_databases]]
binding = "DB"
database_name = "chittypro_streamlink"
database_id = "<create-in-cloudflare-dashboard>"

[vars]
NODE_ENV = "production"
EOF

# 4. Create Cloudflare D1 database
wrangler d1 create chittypro_streamlink

# 5. Deploy to Cloudflare
wrangler deploy --env production
```

## üîß Alternative: Find Your Real Server IP

If you want to deploy traditionally to your server:

```bash
# Option A: Check Cloudflare DNS settings
# Go to: https://dash.cloudflare.com/
# Find derail.me ‚Üí DNS ‚Üí Look for A record pointing to origin server

# Option B: Query origin server if you have Cloudflare API token
curl -X GET "https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/zones/<zone-id>/dns_records" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <your-api-token>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json"

# Option C: Check your hosting provider's control panel
# Find the server's real IP address there
```

## üìã Decision Matrix

| Option | Time to Deploy | Cost | Complexity | Scalability |
|--------|---------------|------|------------|-------------|
| Cloudflare Workers | 10 min | $5-20/mo | Low | Automatic |
| Replace Existing | 30 min | Existing | Medium | Manual |
| Subdomain | 20 min | Existing | Low | Manual |
| Path-based | 30 min | Existing | High | Manual |

## üéØ Next Steps

**Choose your deployment path:**

1. **For Cloudflare Workers** (fastest):
   - Run: `./scripts/deploy-to-cloudflare-workers.sh`
   - Done in 10 minutes!

2. **For traditional server deployment**:
   - Find your server's real IP address
   - Update deployment scripts with real IP
   - SSH to real IP and run setup

3. **For subdomain deployment**:
   - Create subdomain in Cloudflare
   - Point to your server IP
   - Update configuration files
   - Deploy

## üí° Recommendation

Given that derail.me is already on Cloudflare, **I recommend deploying to Cloudflare Workers** for:
- ‚úÖ Instant deployment (no SSH needed)
- ‚úÖ Automatic SSL/HTTPS
- ‚úÖ Global CDN
- ‚úÖ Automatic scaling
- ‚úÖ No server management
